# wikidown

WikiDown is a Vim plugin that provides single-author markdown wiki. The
markdown files can be published to HTML through pandoc.

The design goals are:

* Operate with markdown files.
* No dependence on a new filetype, let people bring their markdown tools.
* Jump to documents through links.
* Support for multiple wikis.
* External tooling for publishing to HTML.
